# HybirdImage
use different frequency of two image to make a hybird image

In this part I input two sigma for the hybrid image. The first one is for highpass andd second one is for lowpass.

My lowpass sigma = 2, highpass sigma = 1.

All kernel size is depending on sigma.

I also have two test images(test1.jpg, test2.jpg) for another result(test_result_(zombie).jpg) with both highpass and lowpass sigma = 1.

The image I used in main function is left.jpg and right.jpg. The final result is hybrid.jpg.
